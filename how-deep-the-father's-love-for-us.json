        "raw_lyrics": "Verse 1 \nHow deep the Father's love for us,\nhow vast beyond all measure\nthat He should give His on - ly Son\nto make a wretch His treasure.\nHow great the pain of sear -ing loss.\nThe Father turns His face away\nas wounds which mar the Cho - sen One\nbring many sons to glo - ry. \n\n\nVerse 2\nBehold the Man upon the cross,\nmy sin upon His shoul - ders.\nAshamed, I hear my mock - ing voice\ncall out among the scoffers.\nIt was my sin that held Him there\nuntil it was accom - plished;\nHis dying breath has brought me life.\nI know that it is fin - ished.\n\n\nVerse 3\nI will not boast in an -y - thing:\nno gifts, no pow'r, no wis - dom.\nBut I will boast in Je - sus Christ:\nHis death and resurrection.\nWhy should I gain from His reward?\nI cannot give an an - swer.\nBut this I know with all my heart:\nHis wounds have paid my ransom."
